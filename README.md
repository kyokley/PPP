# PPP
PPP stands for Pritunl, Pi-hole, and ProtonVPN. The main goal is to increase security and improve privacy protections for users. By using a Pritunl VPN, PPP aims to share a Pi-hole configuration among multiple users in various locations. Therefore, in addition to the usual benefits of using a VPN, ad, tracker, and malware blocking is automatically included. Connections are further routed through an upstream ProtonVPN server for additional IP obfuscation.

## Installation
PPP consists of 3 docker containers, one for each service.
